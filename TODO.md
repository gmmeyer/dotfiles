What I wanna do to make everything better! A ~~cross out~~ means that it's done.

## Setup Script

- testing
- do setup and installation of node, ruby, etc with RVM, NVM, etc in the setup script. (This will require sourcing RVM, etc, from within the setup script.)
- ~~alphebetize the installed packages to make them easier to manage~~
- setup nginx automatically

## Dotfiles

- clean up and organize zshrc
- look into using antigen instead of ohmyzsh

## EMACS

- better syntax highlighting
- don't rely on ubuntu's package manager for emacs packages
- scroll wheel

## Vim

- alias vim='rm -f' and vi='rm -rf'
- look into oh my vim and vundle

## GUI Editor Stuff

- How dumb is it to keep them like this?
  - Explore better ways to do it

## Sublime Text

- Clear out all plugins that weren't installed with Package manager.

## Atom

## Awesome

- Backgrounds
- Widgits.
  - Replace as many autostart (gtk, etc) widgets as I can with awesome widgets.
  - Make a few for cpu load, etc.
