# My Dotfiles!

These are my dotfiles. They probably aren't of terribly much use to you.
If you would like to take from them, be my guest.

About half of them aren't really all that useful or well written, so I wouldn't suggest it.

There are much better people to steal from! Gary Bernhardt, for instance, has some great dotfiles.
